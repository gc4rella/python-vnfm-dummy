# Python Vnfm Dummy
A dummy Vnfm written in python to be used as example of how to use the Python SDK

## Technical Requirements
This section covers the requirements that must be met by the Python Vnfm Dummy in order to satisfy the demands for such a component:

* python-vnfm-sdk

## How to install Python Vnfm Dummy

First install the dependencies in your environment by running

```bash
pip install python-vnfm-sdk
```

Second step, let's create a configuration file for the VNFManager that looks like:

```ini
[vnfm]

endpoint_type=RABBIT
type=python
endpoint=python-endpoint
log_path=/var/log/openbaton/
broker_ip=127.0.0.1
autodelete=true
heartbeat=60
exchange=openbaton-exchange

```

where:

| name            |    description                                   |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| type            |   The type of the vnfm        |
| endpoint_type   |   must be RABBIT                                 |
| broker_ip       |   Ip of the rabbitmq broker used by the nfvo     |
| username        |   username for the rabbitmq broker used to connect to the manager queue of the nfvo|
| password        |   password for the rabbitmq broker used to connect to the manager queue of the nfvo|
| exchange        |   exchange name used in the rabbitmq broker by the nfvo |
| autodelete      |   true or false in case you want the endpoint queue to have the autodelete property (usually true) |
| heartbeat       |   heartbeat for the rabbitmq connection          |
| log_path        |   path where the logfile will be written        |


See the [sdk documentation](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-vnfm-sdk) for more details.

## how to run the dummy vnfm in python
 
Then just clone this repository and within the virtualenv run
 
```bash
python __main__.py
```

## How to extend the Python Vnfm Dummy

This example is a good starting point for creating a Vnfm that has strict dependencies on python libraries

## Issue tracker

Issues and bug reports should be posted to the GitHub Issue Tracker of this project

# What is Open Baton?

OpenBaton is an open source project providing a comprehensive implementation of the ETSI Management and Orchestration (MANO) specification.

Open Baton is a ETSI NFV MANO compliant framework. Open Baton was part of the OpenSDNCore (www.opensdncore.org) project started almost three years ago by Fraunhofer FOKUS with the objective of providing a compliant implementation of the ETSI NFV specification. 

Open Baton is easily extensible. It integrates with OpenStack, and provides a plugin mechanism for supporting additional VIM types. It supports Network Service management either using a generic VNFM or interoperating with VNF-specific VNFM. It uses different mechanisms (REST or PUB/SUB) for interoperating with the VNFMs. It integrates with additional components for the runtime management of a Network Service. For instance, it provides autoscaling and fault management based on monitoring information coming from the the monitoring system available at the NFVI level.
